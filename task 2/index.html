In time, he and his wife Leticia were blessed with opportunities to succeed and have turned their focus to giving others an equal chance. The Leticia & Eduardo Azar Foundation is our self-funded charity and humanitarian organization. We focus on solutions to hunger, homelessness and education, and we also sponsor religious initiatives worldwide. </h5>
